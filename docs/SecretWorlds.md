This room is probably meant to be used for people who are timedout or banned. 

You can not join into it, tried directly and tried using a portal in a custom worlds but both seem to just kick you back to the main hub.

This is interesting, in the remote config it is listed as `homeworldWorldId`, it was last updated in 24/1/2017 meaning that we might never actually see it ingame...
